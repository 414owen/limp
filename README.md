# limp

A general purpose programming language, built with the aim to materialise the following ideas:

1. Simplicity - There is very little syntax.
2. Immutability - Existing state cannot be modified.
3. Less Misdirection - Comments cannot be abused, code is self-documenting.
4. Granularity - Functions must remain small.
